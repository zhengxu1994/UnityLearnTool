The Inventory Engine is a simple yet flexible inventory solution for Unity, available on the Unity Asset Store. Minimal by design, it gives you all you need to create inventories, items, display them, and plug them into your game. Also included in the Corgi Engine, the best platformer asset for Unity, it's a proven and battle tested solution that just gets the job done. 

I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ! 
---------------------------

Have you read the FAQ at http://inventory-engine.moremountains.com/inventory-engine-contact#faq ?
You should read it.

WHAT'S IN THE INVENTORY ENGINE ?  
----------------------------

The asset contains four main folders :

- Demos : Contains demo scenes showcasing the various features of the Inventory Engine. It contains 4 scenes : Minimal 1 and 2, two scenes containing just inventories (no display), linked by the door at the top, so you can go from one another and keep your inventory, and PixelRogue1 and 2, the same thing but with inventory displays in place (press i to open/close the inventory).

- InventoryEngine : This folder contains the core of the engine. You shouldn’t remove it, as everything depends on it, and it contains the base classes and resources that will allow you to create items and inventories

- MMData : This folder probably won’t be here at start. It’ll contain the save files for your inventories. You can safely remove it at anytime if you want to reset your save files. It’ll be created again the next time inventories are saved.

- MMTools : short for More Mountains Tools, a collection of helper scripts used in all the More Mountains assets. Some of these scripts may not be used, but it’s safer to keep this folder, as a lot of the core scripts rely on it. Don’t worry about the unused scripts, they won’t make your build heavier, they’re just ignored during compilation.

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT ?
----------------------------------

The Inventory Engine includes everything you need to add an inventory to your game.
